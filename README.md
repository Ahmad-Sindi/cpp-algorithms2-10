Algorithm Challenge #10 – Print Digits of a Number in Order (Left to Right)
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer and prints each digit in the same order the user entered them (from left to right).

Normally, digits extracted mathematically come out reversed.
To solve this, the algorithm:

1️⃣ Reverses the number

2️⃣ Prints its digits (which restores the original order)

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Digit extraction using modulo and division

Why digits come out reversed by default

How to restore original digit order using a double-step approach

Loop-based digit processing

Clean and modular C++ function design

🧩 Example
-
Input:  

1234

Output:

1

2

3

4


📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: print_digits_in_order.cpp

Challenge Number: #10

💬 Notes
-
This is a clever trick often used in competitive programming and interviews.
It avoids converting the number to a string, using pure arithmetic logic instead.
